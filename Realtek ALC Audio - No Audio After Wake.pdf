Realtek ALC AppleHDA - No Audio After Wake/Sleep [Fixes]

No onboard audio after wake occurs on some systems with all versions of 10.10 and 10.9.2 and newer.  The problem was introduced in 10.9.2, ironically, when Apple tried to fix no audio after wake on native hardware (more information, see Details). For users that believe codec patching causes the problem, the patches do not change a single line of code. Instead, the codec is programmed to support AppleHDA requirements. The specific AppleHDA codec engine is no longer actively supported and, at some point, may be removed. Resolution of this problem is not likely.
